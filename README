This simple GUI lets you browse through images after they are created.

It depends on 5 other scripts:
ParameterStore: Can be used to store parameter values. It is used by the ImageSaver and Logger class. Any other function or class can also use it
ImageSaver enables you to save the image you are currently viewing. This class is used by ImageViewer but can also be used by any other class
Logger: creates a log that can be written to by any script
Singleton ensures that you only work with a single instance of the classes (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24911-design-pattern-singleton-creational)
GetFullPath ensures that a relative path can be converted to a absolute path (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28249-getfullpath)

A collection of snapshots of these scripts are included. For updates wee their cources

example usage:
ps = ParameterStore.instance();
ps.set('defaultLoggerPath','logs'); % otherwise working directory will be used
ps.set('defaultImageSaverPath','images'); % otherwise working directory will be used

iw=ImageViewer();
img1 = imread();
img2 = imread();
iw.addImageFunc(iw.output,img1,'first image');
iw.addImageFunc(iw.output,img2,'second image');

The code ships with an example in imageViewerExample.m
